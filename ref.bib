	abstract = {Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal') is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. Communism is a specific, yet distinct, form of socialism. Communists agree on the withering away of the state but disagree on the means to this end, reflecting a distinction between a more libertarian approach of communization, revolutionary spontaneity, and workers' self-management, and a more vanguardist or Communist party-driven approach through the development of a constitutional socialist state.Variants of communism have been developed throughout history, including anarcho-communism and Marxist schools of thought. Communism includes a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism, Leninism, and libertarian communism as well as the political ideologies grouped around both, all of which share the analysis that the current order of society stems from capitalism, its economic system and mode of production, namely that in this system there are two major social classes, the relationship between these two classes is exploitative, and that this situation can only ultimately be resolved through a social revolution. The two classes are the proletariat (the working class), who make up the majority of the population within society and must work to survive, and the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class), a small minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production. According to this analysis, revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production which is the primary element in the transformation of society towards a communist mode of production.In the 20th century, Communist governments espousing Marxism–Leninism and its variants came into power in parts of the world, first in the Soviet Union with the Russian Revolution of 1917, and then in portions of Eastern Europe, Asia, and a few other regions after World War II. Along with social democracy, communism became the dominant political tendency within the international socialist movement by the 1920s. Criticism of communism can be divided into two broad categories, namely that which concerns itself with the practical aspects of 20th century Communist states and that which concerns itself with communist principles and theory. Several academics and economists, among other scholars, posit that the Soviet model under which these nominally Communist states in practice operated was not an actual communist economic model in accordance with most accepted definitions of communism as an economic theory but in fact a form of state capitalism, or non-planned administrative-command system.},

	copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
	url = {https://id.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hak\_asasi\_manusia\&oldid=19567310},
	abstract = {Hak asasi manusia adalah sebuah konsep hukum dan normatif yang menyatakan bahwa manusia memiliki hak yang melekat pada dirinya karena ia adalah seorang manusia. Hak asasi manusia berlaku kapan saja, di mana saja, dan kepada siapa saja, sehingga sifatnya universal. HAM pada prinsipnya tidak dapat dicabut. Hak asasi manusia juga tidak dapat dibagi-bagi, saling berhubungan, dan saling bergantung. Hak asasi manusia biasanya dialamatkan kepada negara, atau dalam kata lain, negaralah yang mengemban kewajiban untuk menghormati, melindungi, dan memenuhi hak asasi manusia, termasuk dengan mencegah dan menindaklanjuti pelanggaran yang dilakukan oleh swasta. Dalam terminologi modern, hak asasi manusia dapat digolongkan menjadi hak sipil dan politik yang berkenaan dengan kebebasan sipil (misalnya hak untuk hidup, hak untuk tidak disiksa, dan kebebasan berpendapat), serta hak ekonomi, sosial, dan budaya yang berkaitan dengan akses ke barang publik (seperti hak untuk memperoleh pendidikan yang layak, hak atas kesehatan, atau hak atas perumahan).
Secara konseptual, hak asasi manusia dapat dilandaskan pada keyakinan bahwa hak tersebut "dianugerahkan secara alamiah" oleh alam semesta, Tuhan, atau nalar. Sementara itu, mereka yang menolak penggunaan unsur alamiah meyakini bahwa hak asasi manusia merupakan pengejawantahan nilai-nilai yang disepakati oleh masyarakat. Ada pula yang menganggap HAM sebagai perwakilan dari klaim-klaim kaum yang tertindas, dan pada saat yang sama juga terdapat kelompok yang meragukan keberadaan HAM sama sekali dan menyatakan bahwa hak asasi manusia hanya ada karena manusia mencetuskan dan membicarakan konsep tersebut. Dari sudut pandang hukum internasional, hak asasi manusia sendiri dapat dibatasi atau dikurangi dengan syarat-syarat tertentu. Pembatasan biasanya harus ditentukan oleh hukum, memiliki tujuan yang sah, dan diperlukan dalam suatu masyarakat demokratis. Sementara itu, pengurangan hanya dapat dilakukan dalam keadaan darurat yang mengancam "kehidupan bangsa", dan pecahnya perang pun belum mencukupi syarat ini. Selama perang, hukum kemanusiaan internasional berlaku sebagai lex specialis. Walaupun begitu, sejumlah hak tetap tidak boleh dikesampingkan dalam keadaan apapun, seperti hak untuk bebas dari perbudakan maupun penyiksaan.
Masyarakat kuno tidak mengenal konsep hak asasi manusia universal seperti halnya masyarakat modern. Pelopor sebenarnya dari wacana hak asasi manusia adalah konsep hak kodrati yang dikembangkan pada Abad Pencerahan, yang kemudian memengaruhi wacana politik selama Revolusi Amerika dan Revolusi Prancis. Konsep hak asasi manusia modern muncul pada paruh kedua abad kedua puluh, terutama setelah dirumuskannya Pernyataan Umum tentang Hak-Hak Asasi Manusia (PUHAM) di Paris pada tahun 1948. Semenjak itu, hak asasi manusia telah mengalami perkembangan yang pesat dan menjadi semacam kode etik yang diterima dan ditegakkan secara global. Pelaksanaan hak asasi manusia di tingkat internasional diawasi oleh Dewan Hak Asasi Manusia PBB dan badan-badan traktat PBB seperti Komite Hak Asasi Manusia PBB dan Komite Hak Ekonomi, Sosial, dan Budaya, sementara di tingkat regional, hak asasi manusia ditegakkan oleh Pengadilan Hak Asasi Manusia Eropa, Pengadilan Hak Asasi Manusia Antar-Amerika, serta Pengadilan Hak Asasi Manusia dan Hak Penduduk Afrika. Kovenan Internasional tentang Hak-Hak Sipil dan Politik (ICCPR) dan Kovenan Internasional tentang Hak-Hak Ekonomi, Sosial, dan Budaya (ICESCR) sendiri telah diratifikasi oleh hampir semua negara di dunia saat ini.},

The open and ambiguous character of Pancasila allows a wide space for social and political interpretation, and therefore is open to critique and reformation through reinterpretations of its meaning. An examination of the ethics of the socio-political application of Pancasila is crucial in the current national climate, and these ethical valuations are formed through public discussions and debates on the meaning of Pancasila. Using data drawn from mass media. In this paper, I will examine the Government Regulation on Law (Perppu) No. 2/2017 as an example of how these political ethics develop through the discussion of the meaning of Pancasila.\&nbsp; Second, I'll highlight how the space for interpretation of the meaning of Pancasila determines how the public, government and oppositional coalitions evaluate the pro and contra approaches to translating the ideology into practice. Third, in examining the process of socio-political consensus as a necessity in the democratic life of Indonesia, this paper will position the discursive deployments of Pancasila in the ethical and political considerations that stem from the practical application of these discourses of Pancasila.\&nbsp;{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

GPK ini mengajar layaknya guru kelas dan bahkan ada juga yang menjadi guru kelas karena permasalahan kekurangan guru yang dialami pihak sekolah. Dampak yang dialami sekolah dengan tidak tersedianya guru pembimbing khusus dalam pendidikan inklusi adalah pemenuhan kebutuhan ABK terutama program khususnya tidak terpenuhi, ABK dianggap sebagai pengganggu dalam kelancaran pelaksanaan program pendidikan; guru kelas tidak dapat memfasilitasi kebutuhan ABK di kelas; kebijakan sekolah untuk menerima siswa-siswa normal dan ABK dengan tingkat hambatan yang ringan.

Building on this framework, we elaborate a research agenda that proposes [1] examining the role of dynamic capabilities, and [2] accounting for ethical issues as important avenues for future strategic IS research on digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Before the Computer fully explores the data processing industry in the United States from its nineteenth-century inception down to the period when the computer became its primary tool. As James Cortada describes what was once called the "office appliance industry," he challenges our view of the digital computer as a revolutionary technology. Cortada interprets reliance on computers as a development within an important segment of the American economy that was earlier represented largely by such instruments as typewriters, tabulating machines, adding machines, and calculators. He also describes how many of the practices of the office appliance industry evolved into those of the computer world. Drawing on previously unavailable industry archives, the author adds to our understanding of IBM's early history and offers short corporate histories of firms that include NCR, Burroughs, and Remington Rand. Focusing on the United States but also including comparative material on Europe and Asia, Before the Computer will be a unique source of knowledge about the companies that built office equipment and their enormous impact on economic life.Originally published in 1993.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

	abstract = {On 2nd December, 2015, two individuals committed a deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino, California. These individuals used the digital privacy features of their cell phones, which resulted in a complex exchange between the FBI and Apple computer about how to balance the digital
privacy of the individual and still achieve reasonable societal protection. This particular exchange between government and private business is no longer a leading story in the news, but the question of digital privacy management is still an evolving and important business consideration. A
significant number of business, legislative, regulatory, economic and social conditions require that business leaders understand the principles and theoretical frameworks that underpin privacy in the digital age. Financial service organisations, like many businesses, are responsible for significant
volumes of private customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, social security numbers, credit card data and government identification information. Understanding the key attributes of digital privacy is foundational to creating an actionable privacy policy for
business to guide the collection and management of non-public and personally identifiable information. The purpose of this paper is to offer a framework for business and explore the relationship between governance controls, information security and digital privacy and, from this foundation,
examine peer-reviewed literature concerning the attributes of digital privacy.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a model to analyze the inter‐relationship between information transparency and the protection of digital privacy of customers, from the perspective of e‐services providers. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 320 questionnaires were sent out to all e‐banking service providers in the Guangdong province in China in 2004 and 150 useable questionnaires were collected. The response rate was 46.9 percent. Findings – The paper identifies three types of digital privacy: information, communication and individual privacy. The findings show that e‐service marketers who adopt a more open information transparency policy are more likely to pay attention to customers' information and communication privacy, but less to their individual privacy. Practical implications – E‐services providers need to be very careful about the necessity to be transparent in information sharing, but at the same time, have to be well aware of the need of the protection of individual privacy of their customers. Unfortunately, at times they may be too aggressive in adopting an open information transparency policy that may upset their customers by intruding into their individual privacy. Originality/value – The paper contributes to a more comprehensive conceptualization of digital privacy not only by identifying three generic types of privacy (information, communication and individual), but also by looking into the relationship between information transparency and these three generic types of privacy. This study shows that, unlike the first two types of privacy, individual privacy of customers is given less concern by most e‐service providers.},

In particular, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which are open-access online courses that allow for unlimited participation, as well as SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses), are said to have revolutionized universities and the corporate education landscape. In this article we provide a nuanced analysis of the phenomenon of online distance learning. We first provide an overview of its historical evolution, and subsequently define and classify key concepts. We further discuss in detail the optimal target group in terms of participating students and teaching professors and propose corresponding frameworks for driving intrinsic student motivation and for choosing a successful online teacher. We also outline the benefits that institutions can achieve by offering online distance learning. Finally, we speak about the specific connection between online distance learning and social media by focusing on the difference between MOOCs based on traditional lecture formats (xMOOCs) and connectivist cMOOCs.},

But much of the work focused on the types of instructional methods used when teaching online. This focus is problematic due to the fact that some faculty members are suspicious of online courses, have significant reservation about the loss of face-to-face contact, and because distance education was previously viewed as an inferior form of education. Faculty concerns, small sample sizes, and the lack of focus on the field of education, coupled with the growing number of online programs in the area of education lead to a growing need for more research in this area. In an effort to address some of the limitations in the previous research as well as faculty concerns with student learning, this study focuses on learning outcomes and compares an online course and a traditional face-to-face course in an educational research class designed for students pursuing a Master of Science degree in Education. The results from the study were mixed. The results are reported in three sections: (1) papers; (2) exams; and (3) survey data. The limitations of the study are also discussed. Based on the limitations, one additional section on course interaction was added to the analysis. (Contains 4 tables.)},

Lack of resources and, as a result, overload; 2. Redundancy of resources and, as a result, energy loss. Cloud computing allows the scale of resources to be reduced or increased on demand. Many of the gains obtained from the cloud computing come from resource sharing and virtualization technology. On the other hand, the emerging concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can provide a global view of the entire network for integrated resource management. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) can also be used to virtually implement a variety of network devices and functions. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient framework called GreenVoIP to manage the resources of virtualized cloud VoIP centers. By managing the number of VoIP servers and network equipment, such as switches, this framework not only prevents overload but also supports green computing by saving energy. Finally, GreenVoIP is implemented and evaluated on real platforms, including Floodlight, Open vSwitch, and Kamailio. The results suggest that the proposed framework can minimize the number of active devices, prevent overloading, and provide service quality requirements.},

Emergency workers from around the globe raced to help the suffering nation. Two years later, in 2012, Oxfam reported that over 500,000 people were still in displaced persons camps, half of the rubble from the quake was yet to be cleared, cholera had claimed thousands of lives, and 45 per cent of the population still faced food insecurity.1 Michaëlle Jean, the UNESCO Special Envoy for Haiti, explained to the world: [W]hat killed them was not an earthquake. What killed them was negligence; extensive, even murderous negligence. The absence of laws and regulations to standardize construction works, for want of a provident government willing to use its authority to enforce standards, this is what made nearly 300,000 people dead. … A few weeks only after the tragedy in Haiti, an earthquake 500 times more powerful hit Chile … The comparative body count says it all: 486 dead. The example of Peru, another country of high seismic hazard, is just as eloquent: existing solutions that are realistic and achievable, basic engineering regulations that aren’t more expensive, national laws and policies being enforced, a population mobilized, educated, forewarned and empowered …2},

It is, therefore, important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and this paper aims to provide the novice researcher with a basis for developing that understanding. A descriptive analysis of the philosophies of positivism and post-positivist thinking in relation to research methodology is presented both as an introduction to the philosophical basis of research, and as a sound basis from which to discuss the 'quantitative-qualitative' debate.},
